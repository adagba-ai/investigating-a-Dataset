 # Investigating a Dataset
## by Solomon T. Adagba

## Introduction

>In this Project, a sample of 100k medical appointments in Brazil was collected with the aim of determing if patients will show up for their appointment. Specifically, we will be seeking to know what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? These factors includes: Is the Patient enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família?. Did the Patient recieved a Short Message Service (SMS)?. Is the Patient diagnosed of any illness?. How old is a Patient? The result of this analysis will help the medical practioners to make informed decisions.  


## Dataset

> a sample of 100k medical appointments in Brazil. 


## Summary of Findings

>  An analysis was performed on over 100k medical appointments data in Brazil to determined if patients will show up for their appointment. Factors such as Is the Patient enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família?. Did the Patient recieved a Short Message Service (SMS)?. Is the Patient diagnosed of any illness?. How old is a Patient? 

>The step taken during the  data exploration process involve looking at one variable at a time, and then following it up by looking at relationships between variables. Our dependent variable is showing up for a schedule appointment or Not

> After a carefull analysis, the following findings were made. Comparing the mean of the patients who will show up (0.11) for their schedule appointment with those who will not (0.09) to answer the question of if a patient is on the Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família scholarship, we can see that the mean of those who will turn up is significantly higher than those who will not show up. This indicate that these patient are more likely to show up for their scheduled appointment.

>To answer the question of Did the Patient recieved a Short Message Service (SMS)? we consider the inferential statistics of 44% of the Patients who show up having recieved Short Message Service (SMS) as against 29% of the rest. This is a good indication that there is a chance most patient will show when recieve as SMS.

>The average age of those patients who will show up for their slated appointment is 34, this is insignificant to 37 of those patients who will not show up. This implies that younger people are more likely to show up for their schedile appointment compare to older people.

>To answer the question Is the Patient diagnosed of any illness? we observe that 20% of those patients wo are Hipertensive are more likely to show up for their scheduled appointment compare to 16% of those who will not show up.

>Again, we can see that the mean of those patient that will show up shows 0.07 sightly higher than that of the patients who will not show up (0.06). we can say that a patient diagnosed of Diabetes is more likely to shore up for their appointment than those without the illness.

>However, there is no significant difference in the means of Alcoholic and Handicap patient.

>Further research can be carried out in determining the patients average waiting time before their schedule appointment. This will go along way to show if the average waiting time affects whether a patient will show up for their appointment or not.
>One of the limitation observed in the cause of analysis is the lack of proper description of how the data was coded. The documentation did not specify what 0 and 1 means for other factors such as Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap.

>Based on the analysis perform on the Handicap factor, we observed due to the changes on the data, that is instead of having two categories just like every other factor, we have four(4) in this case. This affect corelation between the categories as there is no significant in their means. Therefore, it is difficult to say which patient in these category will show up for an appointment or not
